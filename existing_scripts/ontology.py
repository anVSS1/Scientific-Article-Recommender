"""
Scientific Ontology Manager for Article Recommender

This script manages the scientific domain ontology using OWLReady2 library.
It provides functionality for working with scientific concept hierarchies,
relationships, and semantic reasoning.

Ontology Features:
- Scientific concept taxonomy and hierarchies
- Property relationships between concepts
- Reasoning capabilities for concept inference
- Integration with knowledge graph data

Use Cases:
- Concept hierarchy navigation
- Semantic relationship discovery
- Ontology-based recommendation enhancement
- Knowledge graph enrichment

Dependencies:
- owlready2: OWL ontology manipulation library
- Integration with Neo4j graph database
